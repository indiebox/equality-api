# Equality API

> **Note:** This repository contains the Equality API. If you want to see desktop application, please visit [Equality application repository](https://github.com/indiebox/equality-desktop).

Equality is an easily extensible API that is a tool for effective development control in a small team.

This application includes things such as:
- Kanban board support
- Tracking the contribution of each member
- The possibility of choosing a leader by voting
- ðŸ”¥ And much more ðŸ”¥

# Our goal

Nowadays, most teams are managed by one person. Such a system may be justified for commercial projects, but, in our opinion, it is absolutely unfair for people who are engaged in selfless creativity.
We believe that in such a team, people should choose their own leader and be able to recall him at any time, replacing him with a more suitable one.

Despite the presence of a leader, a number of important issues for the team will be resolved by universal vote of all team members.
