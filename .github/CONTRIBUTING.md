# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Equality! Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting a pull request**.

**This repository is responsible only for **Equality** API.**

If you want to add a request to change the Applications-related functionality, like UI/UX changes, go to [Equality Desktop repository](https://github.com/indiebox/equality-desktop).

## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create [a feature request](https://github.com/indiebox/equality-api/discussions/new?category=ideas) to first discuss any significant new ideas. This includes things that related to API functionality, like
new endpoints, etc.
